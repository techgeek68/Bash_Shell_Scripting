# Teaching Notes & Tips

- Encourage students to use `set -euo pipefail` in scripts to catch common issues.
- Emphasize quoting variables to avoid word-splitting bugs.
- For portability, prefer POSIX-friendly patterns when possible but explain bash-specific features (arrays, associative arrays).
- Provide small realistic datasets for labs: HR CSV, climate CSV, sample model outputs.
- Use version control: ask students to submit scripts via a GitHub repo for the final project.
